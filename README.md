### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an engineering student in a french engineering school. I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence. 
I aim to develop purposeful AI in order to help people in their daily life.
To my mind AI is a technology with the potential to assist disable people. It might not be a magic bullet, but it may be determining for them.
Empowering people to develop their creativity and push their boundaries is also something I look up to. 

Thanks for coming hereðŸ˜„
